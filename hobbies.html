      <h2>Music Production</h2>
      <p>I've always had an obsession with music since a young age. After saving the majority of my income from my first job, I was able to purchase the necessary equipment to build my own home-studio. Once I began producing music, it felt as though I was destined for the path of a music producer. Unfortunately, this is a tough road to follow and the chances of success are slim.</p>
      <p> It's not that I'm opposed to taking risks, but I like to operate my life with some level of rational thinking. It wasn't until I discovered the world of web-development, where I had an epiphany that I could essentially combine various passions and bring something new to the table. I would have the ability to develop in-demand skills while still getting a cathartic release from creative expression. This is the start of the new chapter.

      <h2>Photography</h2>
      <p>My passion for photography began very recently. I became friends with some very talented photographers and it opened my eyes to the beauty of the artform, and the value of being able to capture certain moments. I went on a trip last summer with one of my good friends where we ended up motorcycling through southern Vietnam. I really wanted to be able to capture these experiences in the best way possible so I spent many hours studying and researching various photography techniques.</p>
      <p>Like most skills, I find the more I learned about photography, the more I realized I didn't know. While this could be looked upon as detriment to some, I get extremely motivated by my lack of knowledge, and it pushes me to learn new things everyday.</p>
